class Aberration:
    """Represents the aberration correction options in ANISE.

In space science and engineering, accurately pointing instruments (like optical cameras or radio antennas) at a target is crucial. This task is complicated by the finite speed of light, necessitating corrections for the apparent position of the target.

This structure holds parameters for aberration corrections applied to a target's position or state vector. These corrections account for the difference between the target's geometric (true) position and its apparent position as observed.

# Rule of tumb
In most Earth orbits, one does _not_ need to provide any aberration corrections. Light time to the target is less than one second (the Moon is about one second away).
In near Earth orbits, e.g. inner solar system, preliminary analysis can benefit from enabling unconverged light time correction. Stellar aberration is probably not required.
For deep space missions, preliminary analysis would likely require both light time correction and stellar aberration. Mission planning and operations will definitely need converged light-time calculations.

    This function computes the time it will take for the orbiting body to reach

    two-body dynamics and considers the direction of motion.

    # Assumptions & Limitations

    - Assumes pure Keplerian motion.
    - For elliptical orbits, if the radius is reachable at two points (ascending and descending parts
    of the orbit), this function calculates the time to reach the radius corresponding to the
    true anomaly in `[0, PI]` (typically the ascending part or up to apoapsis if starting past periapsis).
    - For circular orbits, if the radius is within the apoapse and periapse, then a duration of zero is returned.
    - For hyperbolic/parabolic orbits, the true anomaly at radius is also computed in `[0, PI]`. If this
    point is in the past, the function returns an error, as it doesn't look for solutions on the
    departing leg if `nu > PI` would be required (unless current TA is already > PI and target radius is further along).
    The current implementation strictly uses the `acos` result, so `nu_rad_at_radius` is always `0 <= nu <= PI`.
    This means it finds the time to reach the radius on the path from periapsis up to the point where true anomaly is PI."""

    Given the embedded sine functions in the equation to compute the difference between TDB and TAI from the number of TDB seconds
    past J2000, one cannot solve the revert the operation analytically. Instead, we iterate until the value no longer changes.

    1. Assume that the TAI duration is in fact the TDB seconds from J2000.
    2. Offset to J2000 because `Epoch` stores everything in the J1900 but the TDB duration is in J2000.
    3. Compute the offset `g` due to the TDB computation with the current value of the TDB seconds (defined in step 1).
    4. Subtract that offset to the latest TDB seconds and store this as a new candidate for the true TDB seconds value.
    5. Compute the difference between this candidate and the previous one. If the difference is less than one nanosecond, stop iteration.
    6. Set the new candidate as the TDB seconds since J2000 and loop until step 5 breaks the loop, or we've done five iterations.
    7. At this stage, we have a good approximation of the TDB seconds since J2000.
    8. Reverse the algorithm given that approximation: compute the `g` offset, compute the difference between TDB and TAI, add the TT offset (32.184 s), and offset by the difference between J1900 and J2000."""

    Euler parameters, also known as unit quaternions, are a set of four parameters `b0`, `b1`, `b2`, and `b3`.
    For clarity, in ANISE, these are denoted `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`.
    They are an extension of the concept of using Euler angles for representing orientations and are
    particularly useful because they avoid gimbal lock and are more compact than rotation matrices.

    # Definitions

    Euler parameters are defined in terms of the axis of rotation and the angle of rotation. If a body
    rotates by an angle `θ` about an axis defined by the unit vector `e = [e1, e2, e3]`, the Euler parameters
    are defined as:

    b0 = cos(θ / 2)
    b1 = e1 * sin(θ / 2)
    b2 = e2 * sin(θ / 2)
    b3 = e3 * sin(θ / 2)

    These parameters have the property that `b0^2 + b1^2 + b2^2 + b3^2 = 1`, which means they represent
    a rotation in SO(3) and can be used to interpolate rotations smoothly.

    # Applications

    In the context of spacecraft mechanics, Euler parameters are often used because they provide a

    are present with Euler angles.
