class Aberration:
    """Represents the aberration correction options in ANISE.

In space science and engineering, accurately pointing instruments (like optical cameras or radio antennas) at a target is crucial. This task is complicated by the finite speed of light, necessitating corrections for the apparent position of the target.

This structure holds parameters for aberration corrections applied to a target's position or state vector. These corrections account for the difference between the target's geometric (true) position and its apparent position as observed.

# Rule of tumb
In most Earth orbits, one does _not_ need to provide any aberration corrections. Light time to the target is less than one second (the Moon is about one second away).
In near Earth orbits, e.g. inner solar system, preliminary analysis can benefit from enabling unconverged light time correction. Stellar aberration is probably not required.
For deep space missions, preliminary analysis would likely require both light time correction and stellar aberration. Mission planning and operations will definitely need converged light-time calculations.

The Beta angle (β) is defined as the angle between the orbit plane of a spacecraft and the vector from the central body (e.g., Earth) to the Sun. In simpler terms, it measures how much of the time a satellite in orbit is exposed to direct sunlight.

    Given the embedded sine functions in the equation to compute the difference between TDB and TAI from the number of TDB seconds
    past J2000, one cannot solve the revert the operation analytically. Instead, we iterate until the value no longer changes.

    1. Assume that the TAI duration is in fact the TDB seconds from J2000.
    2. Offset to J2000 because `Epoch` stores everything in the J1900 but the TDB duration is in J2000.
    3. Compute the offset `g` due to the TDB computation with the current value of the TDB seconds (defined in step 1).
    4. Subtract that offset to the latest TDB seconds and store this as a new candidate for the true TDB seconds value.
    5. Compute the difference between this candidate and the previous one. If the difference is less than one nanosecond, stop iteration.
    6. Set the new candidate as the TDB seconds since J2000 and loop until step 5 breaks the loop, or we've done five iterations.
    7. At this stage, we have a good approximation of the TDB seconds since J2000.
    8. Reverse the algorithm given that approximation: compute the `g` offset, compute the difference between TDB and TAI, add the TT offset (32.184 s), and offset by the difference between J1900 and J2000."""
