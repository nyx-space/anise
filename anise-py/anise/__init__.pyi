In space science and engineering, accurately pointing instruments (like optical cameras or radio antennas) at a target is crucial. This task is complicated by the finite speed of light, necessitating corrections for the apparent position of the target.

In most Earth orbits, one does _not_ need to provide any aberration corrections. Light time to the target is less than one second (the Moon is about one second away).
In near Earth orbits, e.g. inner solar system, preliminary analysis can benefit from enabling unconverged light time correction. Stellar aberration is probably not required.
For deep space missions, preliminary analysis would likely require both light time correction and stellar aberration. Mission planning and operations will definitely need converged light-time calculations.

The report event function starts by lineraly scanning the whole state spec from the start to the end epoch.
This uses an adaptive step scan modeled on the Runge Kutta adaptive step integrator, but the objective is to ensure that the scalar expression
of the event is evaluated at steps where it is linearly changing (to within 10% of linearity). This allows finding coarse brackets where
the expression changes signs exactly once.
Then, each bracket it sent in parallel to a Brent's method root finder to find the exact time of the event.

# Limitation
While this approach is both very robust and very fast, if you think the finder may be missing some events, you should _reduce_ the epoch precision
of the event as a multiplicative factor of that precision is used to scan the trajectory linearly. Alternatively, you may export the scalars at
