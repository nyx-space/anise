    """Represents the aberration correction options in ANISE.

In space science and engineering, accurately pointing instruments (like optical cameras or radio antennas) at a target is crucial. This task is complicated by the finite speed of light, necessitating corrections for the apparent position of the target.

This structure holds parameters for aberration corrections applied to a target's position or state vector. These corrections account for the difference between the target's geometric (true) position and its apparent position as observed.

# Rule of tumb
In most Earth orbits, one does _not_ need to provide any aberration corrections. Light time to the target is less than one second (the Moon is about one second away).
In near Earth orbits, e.g. inner solar system, preliminary analysis can benefit from enabling unconverged light time correction. Stellar aberration is probably not required.
For deep space missions, preliminary analysis would likely require both light time correction and stellar aberration. Mission planning and operations will definitely need converged light-time calculations.

This method uses a Brent solver, provides a superlinearity convergence (Golden ratio rate).
If the function that defines the event is not unimodal, the event finder may not converge correctly.

any gap whose median repetition is greater than 125% will be slow searches. This _typically_ finds all of the events ... but it
may also add duplicates! To prevent reporting duplicate events, the found events are deduplicated if the same event is found
within 3 times the epoch precision. For example, if the epoch precision is 100 ms, if three events are "found" within 300 ms of each other

The initial search step is 1% of the duration requested, if the heuristic is set to None.
For example, if the trajectory is 100 days long, then we split the trajectory into 100 chunks of 1 day and see whether
