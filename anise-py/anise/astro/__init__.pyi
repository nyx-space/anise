This function computes the time it will take for the orbiting body to reach

two-body dynamics and considers the direction of motion.

# Assumptions & Limitations

- Assumes pure Keplerian motion.
- For elliptical orbits, if the radius is reachable at two points (ascending and descending parts
of the orbit), this function calculates the time to reach the radius corresponding to the
true anomaly in `[0, PI]` (typically the ascending part or up to apoapsis if starting past periapsis).
- For circular orbits, if the radius is within the apoapse and periapse, then a duration of zero is returned.
- For hyperbolic/parabolic orbits, the true anomaly at radius is also computed in `[0, PI]`. If this
point is in the past, the function returns an error, as it doesn't look for solutions on the
departing leg if `nu > PI` would be required (unless current TA is already > PI and target radius is further along).
The current implementation strictly uses the `acos` result, so `nu_rad_at_radius` is always `0 <= nu <= PI`.
This means it finds the time to reach the radius on the path from periapsis up to the point where true anomaly is PI."""
