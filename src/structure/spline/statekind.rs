/// State Kind defines what kind of state is stored in the spline.
///
/// # Limitations
/// 1. The interpolation degree of all items in the state must be identical.
/// 2. A constant position must be encoded as degree 1 whose sole coefficient is the constant value.
///
/// ## Example
/// If the position is interpolated with an 11 degree polynomial, and the velocity must also be interpolated with an 11 degree polynomial.
///
/// # Encoding / decoding
/// The state kind is encoded along with its degree as a single field in the ASN1 encoding scheme.
/// The interpolation degrees are expressed on an 8-bit unsigned integer whose maximum value is 255 (2^8 - 1).
/// Hence, to encode both the state kind and the interpolation degree, a spacing of 255 is used between each state kind.
///
/// ASN1 encodes the tag and length as one octet each. Hence, position state metadata will always fit in exactly three octets: tag (1), length (1), degree (1).
/// Position and velocity data will fit in four octets: tag (1), length (1), data (2). And so on for each state kind.
/// Had the degree and state kind been stored as separate fields, we would be constantly using exactly six octets.
///
/// The other advantage is that a single ASN1 tag decoding will yield both the state kind and the degree: this allows the code to store both the state kind and the degree in the same enumerate structure.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// | Encoded value | State Kind | Degree |
/// | -- | -- | -- |
/// | 1 | Position only | 1
/// | 28 | Position only | 28
/// | 266 | Position and Velocity | 266-255 = 11
/// | 0 | None | _not applicable_
///
/// # Storage
///
/// Position data will always require three fields (x, y, z). Velocity adds another three (vx, vy, vz), and so does acceleration (ax, ay, az).
///
/// ## Example
/// Storing the position and velocity with an 11 degree polynomial will require 11*6 = 66 coefficient. Each coefficient is stored as packed structure of 8 octets floating point values in IEEE754 format.
/// Hence, this would require 66*8 = 528 octets per spline.
