/// Covariance Kind defines what kind of covariance is stored in the spline, if at all.
/// Under the hood, this works exactly like [StateKind] since the CovKind structure has a single field `data` which is a StateKind.
///
/// # Storage requirements and field ordering
/// Covariance information requires more data than just a state since it includes both the covariance and the variance between different elements.
/// In ANISE, this is stored as an upper triangular matrix.
///
/// ## Position variance storage
///
/// The order of the data is as follows:
/// 1. cov_x_x
/// 2. cov_y_x
/// 3. cov_y_y
/// 4. cov_z_x
/// 5. cov_z_y
/// 6. cov_z_z
///
/// Hence, if the covariance is interpolated with a degree 6, then the position covariance of a single spline is stored as a contiguous octet array of 288 octets:
///
/// | field | length | start octet | end octet
/// | -- | -- | -- | -- |
/// | cov_x_x | 6*8 = 48 | 0 | 47
/// | cov_y_x | 6*8 = 48 | 48 | 95
/// | cov_y_y | 48 | 96 | 143
/// | cov_z_x | 48 | 144 | 191
/// | cov_z_y | 48 | 192 | 239
/// | cov_z_z | 48 | 240 | 287
///
/// ### Example
/// Storing the position and velocity covariance, interpolated as a 6 degree polynomial will require **6** fields of **6 * 8 = 48* octets each, leading to **288 octets per spline**.
///
/// ## Position and velocity variance storage
///
/// It is not possible to store the velocity variance without also storing the position variance. If we've missed a use case where this is relevant, please open an issue.
///
/// Additional fields for the velocity variance.
///
/// + cov_vx_x
/// + cov_vx_y
/// + cov_vx_z
/// + cov_vx_vx
///  
/// + cov_vy_x
/// + cov_vy_y
/// + cov_vy_z
/// + cov_vy_vx
/// + cov_vy_vy
///
/// + cov_vz_x
/// + cov_vz_y
/// + cov_vz_z
/// + cov_vz_vx
/// + cov_vz_vy
/// + cov_vz_vz
///
/// ### Example
/// Storing the position and velocity covariance, interpolated as a 6 degree polynomial will require **6 + 15 = 21** fields of **6 * 8 = 48* octets each, leading to **1008 octets per spline**.
///
/// ## Position, velocity, and acceleration variance storage
///
/// We also don't know of a use case where one would need to store the variance of the acceleration, but it's supported because the support is relatively easy.
/// **Warning:** this will add 7+8+9 = 24 fields, each storing one 64-bit floating point number _per interpolation degree_.

/// ### Example
/// Storing the full covariance of position, velocity, and acceleration, interpolated as a 6 degree polynomial will require **6 + 15 + 24 = 45** fields of **6 * 8 = 48* octets each, leading to **2160 octets per spline**.
