/// Represents the aberration correction options in ANISE.
///
/// In space science and engineering, accurately pointing instruments (like optical cameras or radio antennas) at a target is crucial. This task is complicated by the finite speed of light, necessitating corrections for the apparent position of the target.
///
/// This structure holds parameters for aberration corrections applied to a target's position or state vector. These corrections account for the difference between the target's geometric (true) position and its apparent position as observed.
///
/// # Rule of tumb
/// In most Earth orbits, one does _not_ need to provide any aberration corrections. Light time to the target is less than one second (the Moon is about one second away).
/// In near Earth orbits, e.g. inner solar system, preliminary analysis can benefit from enabling unconverged light time correction. Stellar aberration is probably not required.
/// For deep space missions, preliminary analysis would likely require both light time correction and stellar aberration. Mission planning and operations will definitely need converged light-time calculations.
///
/// For more details, <https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/abcorr.html>.
///
/// # SPICE Validation
///
/// The validation test `validate_jplde_de440s_aberration_lt` checks 101,000 pairs of ephemeris computations and shows that the unconverged Light Time computation matches the SPICE computations almost all the time.
/// More specifically, the 99th percentile of error is less than 5 meters, the 75th percentile is less than one meter, and the median error is less than 2 millimeters.
