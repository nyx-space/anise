# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style
- **Technical & Precise:** All documentation and project communications must be precise, authoritative, and focused on technical accuracy. Use industry-standard terminology consistently.

## Design & UX Principles
- **Correctness First:** Prioritize explicit error handling and type safety above all else. The system should make it difficult to perform invalid operations and provide clear, actionable feedback when errors occur.
- **Performance-Oriented:** Ensure high performance and low latency in all operations, especially for parallel and high-throughput workloads.

## Accessibility & Inclusivity
- **Standard Compliance:** Follow standard best practices for accessibility in documentation and any graphical interfaces to ensure the project is usable by the broadest possible audience.
